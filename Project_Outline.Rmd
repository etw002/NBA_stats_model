## Model
- games played(frequency) $\times$ stats per game(severity) = total points per season

## frequency - games played
- negative binomial or poisson glm
- predictors - games played per season(sum of games/82), year played(to - from), injury history(dnp & reason=injury), total minutes, starter/bench, fouls

removing season_type - 2(regular season),3(play-in),5(playoffs)

## Severity- points per 100 poss
- gamma or tweedie
- points, usage rate, fg%, ft%, starter/bench, position
- usage rate formula - 100 * ((Player FGA+0.44*PlayerFTA+PlayerTO)*Teamminutes/5)
/(TeamFGA+0.44*TeamFTA+TeamTO)*playerminutes)
